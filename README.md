# ⚡ UV — The Blazing-Fast Python Project Manager

> **One tool to rule them all** — UV is a modern, lightning-fast Python package and dependency manager that combines the best of Poetry, pip, and pyenv into a single tool.

---

## 🚀 Introduction

Meet **UV**, the new powerhouse in Python project management.  
Forget the days of juggling `poetry`, `requirements.txt`, and `pyenv` — **UV does it all**, and it does it _blazingly fast_.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Install UV
- Initialize and manage a Python project
- Add dependencies and dev dependencies
- Manage Python versions effortlessly
- Run commands in isolated environments
- Enjoy a seamless, cross-platform workflow

---

## 🧩 Installation

You can install UV in several ways — via **curl**, **pip**, or **PowerShell** (for Windows).  
Here’s an example using **curl**:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
````

Once installed, confirm with:

```bash
uv --version
```

---

## ⚙️ Project Initialization

To create a new project, simply run:

```bash
uv init
```

This will generate a `pyproject.toml` file — a clean and organized configuration that includes:

- Project metadata
- Dependencies
- Python version

By default, UV might select an older Python version (e.g., 3.8), but you can easily update it (see below 👇).

---

## 📦 Adding Dependencies

Adding packages is seamless:

```bash
uv add typer
```

You’ll immediately see `typer` listed under your dependencies in the `pyproject.toml` file.

To add **development dependencies**, just use the `--dev` flag:

```bash
uv add pytest --dev
```

---

## 🧪 Running Commands

Let’s create a simple test setup:

```bash
mkdir tests
echo "def test_main(): assert True" > tests/test_main.py
```

Run your tests directly inside UV’s virtual environment:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

✨ **Note:** UV automatically creates a virtual environment (`.venv`) and manages dependencies for you.

---

## 🐍 Managing Python Versions

UV can install and switch Python versions effortlessly.

Check your current version:

```bash
uv run python --version
```

To upgrade your project to a newer Python version (e.g., 3.14):

1. Edit your `pyproject.toml`:

   ```toml
   requires-python = ">=3.14"
   ```

2. Sync the environment:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

UV will automatically:

- Install Python 3.14
- Update your virtual environment
- Sync dependencies and lock files

---

## ⚡ Speed Test

UV is _incredibly fast_.
You can install heavy hitters like **FastAPI**, **Jupyter**, and **Pandas** in just seconds:

```bash
uv add fastapi jupyter pandas
```

Everything installs, resolves, and locks in under two seconds. 🔥

You can even launch Jupyter directly:

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

---

## 🧰 Using `uvx` (Standalone Tools)

Need to run a one-off tool like **Ruff** for linting or formatting?
No need to install it in your project — use **`uvx`**:

```bash
uvx ruff check
uvx ruff format
```

`uvx` runs tools in a completely **isolated environment**, leaving your project dependencies untouched.

---

## 🏁 Summary

With **UV**, you can:

- ✅ Initialize and manage Python projects
- ✅ Add, lock, and sync dependencies instantly
- ✅ Manage Python versions effortlessly
- ✅ Run commands and tools in isolated environments
- ✅ Enjoy unmatched speed and simplicity

---

## 💬 Conclusion

**UV** is redefining Python project management — clean, fast, and powerful.
Once you try it, it might just become your favorite Python tool.
